## Interactive Conky demos
These are two examples of how to make conky interactive.

The demos use python3 and have instructions for how to setup the keybindings for i3wm.

###conkygame
is a simple ASCII conky game where you move a character on a 2D grid.

###tictactoe
is an implementation of tic-tac-toe in conky.

*I hope this will inspire someone to do some really awesome stuff with conky!*
